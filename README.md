## Overview

Bookmark Manager Zero is a Firefox extension that provides a beautiful, feature-rich sidebar interface for managing your **native Firefox bookmarks**. No cloud sync, no self-hosting, no separate accounts—it works directly with the bookmarks already built into your browser.

Changes sync **bi-directionally and instantly**: any edits made in Bookmark Manager Zero immediately appear in Firefox's native bookmark system, and vice versa. Don't worry about accidental changes—the built-in undo feature lets you quickly restore recently deleted bookmarks.

It enhances your bookmark management experience with modern UI, advanced search, safety checking, and intelligent organization tools while keeping your data exactly where it belongs: in Firefox.

### Why Bookmark Manager Zero?

**The only bookmark manager with integrated security scanning.**

Other bookmark tools make you choose between organization OR security. Bookmark Manager Zero combines both:

| Feature | Bookmark Manager Zero | [Bookmarks clean up](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/bookmarks-clean-up/) | [Bookmarks Organizer](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/bookmarks-organizer/) | [Malware & URL Scanner](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pinkddkghldnoglcngpeolboghcbenfh) |

## How Link & Safety Checking Works

This section provides technical details on how the extension determines link status and safety for anyone interested in the methodology.

### Link Status Checking

The extension checks if bookmark URLs are still accessible and categorizes them as **Live**, **Dead**, or **Parked**.

#### Detection Method

1. **Initial Domain Check**: The URL's domain is first checked against a list of 22+ known domain parking services:
   - **Registrars**: HugeDomains, GoDaddy, Namecheap, NameSilo, Porkbun, Dynadot, Epik
   - **Marketplaces**: Sedo, Dan.com, Afternic, DomainMarket, Squadhelp, BrandBucket, Undeveloped, Atom
   - **Parking Services**: Bodis, ParkingCrew, Above.com, SedoParking

2. **HTTP HEAD Request**: A lightweight HEAD request is sent with CORS mode to track redirects (10-second timeout)
   - No page content is downloaded
   - Credentials are omitted for privacy
   - Falls back to no-cors mode if CORS is blocked

3. **Redirect Detection**: If the URL redirects to a different domain, the final destination is checked against parking domain lists
   - Example: `example.com` → `hugedomains.com/domain/example.com` = **Parked**
   - Same-site redirects (www, HTTPS) are not flagged

4. **Response Interpretation**:
   - **Successful response** → Live
   - **Redirects to parking domain** → Parked
   - **Timeout/Network Error** → Dead

5. **Fallback Strategy**: If HEAD fails, a GET request is attempted with the same redirect detection logic

#### Rate Limiting
Bookmarks are scanned in batches of 5 with a 1-second delay between batches. This prevents overwhelming your network with too many DNS requests at once.

#### Caching
Results are cached locally for 7 days to minimize network requests.

---

### Safety Checking

The extension checks URLs against multiple threat databases to identify malicious, phishing, or scam websites.

#### Phase 1: Blocklist Lookup (Free, No API Key Required)

URLs are checked against eight community-maintained blocklists with dual URLhaus coverage:

| Source | Type | Description | Entries |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| **[URLhaus (Active)](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/)** | Malware URLs | Official abuse.ch list - actively distributing malware (updated every 5 min) | ~107K |
| **[URLhaus (Historical)](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/)** | Malware Domains | Historical threats via CDN mirror (updated every 12 hours) | ~37K |
| **[BlockList Project - Malware](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Malware Domains | Community-maintained malware domain list | 435K |
| **[BlockList Project - Phishing](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Phishing Domains | Known phishing sites | 190K |
| **[BlockList Project - Scam](https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists)** | Scam Domains | Known scam websites | 1.3K |
| **[HaGeZi TIF](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists)** | Threat Intel Feeds | Comprehensive malware, phishing, and scam domains | 608K |
| **[Phishing-Filter](https://gitlab.com/malware-filter/phishing-filter)** | Phishing URLs | Aggregated phishing database from OpenPhish & PhishTank | ~21K |
| **[OISD Big](https://oisd.nl/)** | Multi-source | Comprehensive blocklist aggregator covering malware, ads, trackers | ~215K |

**Total Coverage**: **~1.35M unique malicious domains** after deduplication (from 1.6M total entries)

**Implementation Details:**
- Blocklists are downloaded and cached locally in IndexedDB
- Updated every 24 hours automatically
- URLhaus Active uses CORS proxy to access official abuse.ch list with full URL context
- URLhaus Historical uses GitHub mirror for redundancy and historical coverage
- OISD Big uses GitHub mirror to avoid CORS restrictions
- Both full URLs and domain:port combinations are checked
- Dual URLhaus sources provide complementary coverage (active threats + historical data)
- Domain-level matching catches malicious IPs even if specific path differs
- **Any match → Unsafe** (tooltip shows all sources that flagged it)
- All scanning continues through every layer to aggregate findings
- Suspicious pattern detection provides additional coverage for IP-based threats

#### Phase 2: Google Safe Browsing (Optional, Requires Free API Key)

If configured, URLs are checked against Google's threat database:

- **Threat Types Checked**: Malware, Social Engineering, Unwanted Software, Potentially Harmful Applications
- **Method**: POST request to Safe Browsing API v4
- **Rate Limit**: 10,000 requests/day (free tier)
- **Results aggregated** with other findings (doesn't stop scanning)

#### Phase 3: Yandex Safe Browsing (Optional, Requires Free API Key)

If configured, provides geographic threat diversity:

- **Coverage**: Russian and Eastern European threats
- **Method**: POST request to Yandex Safe Browsing API
- **Rate Limit**: 100,000 requests/day (free tier)
- **Results aggregated** with other findings

#### Phase 4: VirusTotal (Optional, Requires Free API Key)

If configured, URLs are submitted to VirusTotal's multi-engine scanner:

1. URL is submitted for analysis
2. Results are retrieved after 2 seconds
3. 70+ antivirus engines analyze the URL

**Threat Determination**:
- **2+ engines flag as malicious → Unsafe**
- **1 malicious OR 2+ suspicious → Warning**
- **0 detections → Safe**

**Rate Limit**: 500 requests/day, 4 requests/minute (free tier)

#### Phase 5: Suspicious Pattern Detection

The URL is analyzed for suspicious patterns (scanning continues regardless of previous results):

| Pattern | Detection | Result |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **HTTP Only (Unencrypted)** | URL uses `http://` and doesn't redirect to HTTPS | Warning |
| **HTTP Only (redirects to HTTPS)** | URL uses `http://` but site redirects to HTTPS | Warning (informational) |
| **URL Shortener** | Domain is bit.ly, tinyurl.com, t.co, etc. (18+ services) | Warning |
| **Suspicious TLD** | Domain ends in .xyz, .top, .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, .gq, .cc, etc. (30+ TLDs) | Warning |
| **IP Address** | URL uses IP address instead of domain name (IPv4 or IPv6) | Warning |

**Note:** Multiple patterns can be detected simultaneously (e.g., HTTP + Suspicious TLD).

#### Final Status Determination

**Scanning Methodology**: All layers are checked sequentially, and results are aggregated. The extension does NOT stop at the first flag—it continues through all enabled layers to provide comprehensive threat intelligence.

| Check Result | Final Status | Priority |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Blocklist match (any source) | **Unsafe** (red shield) | Highest |
| Google Safe Browsing match | **Unsafe** (red shield) | Highest |
| Yandex Safe Browsing match | **Unsafe** (red shield) | Highest |
| VirusTotal 2+ malicious | **Unsafe** (red shield) | Highest |
| VirusTotal 1 malicious or 2+ suspicious | **Warning** (yellow shield) | Medium |
| Suspicious patterns found | **Warning** (yellow shield) | Medium |
| All checks pass | **Safe** (green shield) | Normal |

**Multi-Source Attribution**: Tooltips display all sources that flagged a URL (e.g., "Detected by: URLhaus, Google Safe Browsing, Suspicious TLD"). This provides transparency and helps identify false positives.

#### Caching & Privacy

- All results are cached locally for 7 days
- Only URLs are sent to external services (no personal data)
- API keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
- All features can be disabled in settings

---

### Whitelisting

Users can whitelist specific URLs to:
- Skip safety checks for trusted sites
- Override false positives
- Whitelisted bookmarks display a white shield indicator instead of green
- Add/remove from whitelist via bookmark context menu (right-click)
- Use the "Trusted" filter to view all whitelisted bookmarks
- Whitelist is stored locally and persists across sessions

**New Features:**
- 🎨 **Bookmark Opacity Slider** - Control bookmark background transparency (0-100%) directly from Theme menu
- ✍️ **Custom Text Color Picker** - Full color customization for bookmark and folder text with visual color picker and reset button
- 🎨 **Light Gray Default** - Text color defaults to light gray (#e8e8e8) which works reliably with Firefox's color picker
- ⚡ **Real-Time Color Preview** - Color pickers apply changes instantly as you adjust colors

**Improvements:**
- 📐 **Improved Menu Positioning** - All menus (Theme, View, Zoom, Settings) now respect 16px margins from viewport edges
- 🎯 **Enhanced Context Menu** - Bookmark context menus never extend behind toolbar, with better overflow handling
- 📱 **Better Responsive Menus** - Menus scale properly to viewport width with increased margins for cleaner layout
- 🎨 **Reorganized Theme Menu** - Bookmark Opacity, Accent Color, and Text Color logically grouped for easy access
- 🎯 **Reduced Font Sizes** - Accent Color and Text Color labels now use matching 11px font size for consistency

**Bug Fixes:**
- 🐛 **Firefox Color Picker Workaround** - Fixed Firefox bug where pure white (#ffffff) prevented custom color selection by using light gray default
- 🐛 Fixed context menus sometimes positioning behind header/toolbar
- 🐛 Fixed menu overflow on narrow viewports
- 🐛 Fixed opacity affecting text readability (now only affects background via CSS pseudo-element)
- 🐛 Fixed text color not affecting bookmark URLs (now applies to URLs in addition to titles and folder names)
- 🐛 Fixed menu positioning calculations for edge cases

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Bookmark Opacity**: Uses CSS `::before` pseudo-element to apply opacity only to the background layer, keeping text and icons at full opacity for better readability. The opacity value is controlled via CSS variable `--bookmark-container-opacity`.
- **Text Color**: Uses CSS `custom-text-color-style` that persists across dynamic DOM changes. Targets `.bookmark-title`, `.folder-title`, and `.bookmark-url` elements specifically for precise color control.
- **Firefox Color Picker**: Pure white (#ffffff) as default value prevents Firefox's native color picker from initializing the custom color gradient area. Using #e8e8e8 (light gray) works around this browser bug while remaining visually close to white. Users can still select pure white after initialization.
